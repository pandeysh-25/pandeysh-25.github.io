Hi there! 
<br>
<br>
I'm Shashank, a Master's student at New York University, currently studying Computer Science. 
<br>
<br>
I'm currently interning at DynPro, where I am working on developing internal data analytics tools and generating dashboards from natural language queries. Last semester, I served as a Teaching Assistant at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences for the Natural Language Processing course under Prof. Meyers. Previously, I spent a summer at PayPal, where I built a model to flag suspicious phones used by consumers. I have also interned at the Indian Institute of Science, where I gained experience in full-stack development and software engineering practices.
<br>
<br>
My main areas of interest lie in at-scale data engineering, NLP, and extracting insights from data. In the past, I have worked as a Research Assistant under Dr. Prajna Upadhyay (at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad) in NLP.  As part of her research group, I co-authored a paper on information extraction from legal sentences, which we presented at the NLLP workshop held at EMNLP 2024.
<br>
<br>
I graduated with a Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2024, with a Minor degree in Data Science. 
<br>
<br>
Coming to my hobbies and interests, I am an avid sports fan, and closely follow football (soccer), tennis, and Formula 1. I also love reading about urban policy and macroeconomics, and am intrigued by the potential of data in quantifying the (often unforeseen) impacts of policy on people. I enjoy reading books, listening to music, and exploring different cities.

    abstract = "Constructing legal knowledge graphs from unstructured legal texts is a complex challenge due to the intricate nature of legal language. While open information extraction (OIE) techniques can convert text into triples of the form subject, relation, object, they often fall short of capturing the nuanced relationships within lengthy legal sentences, necessitating more sophisticated approaches known as complex information extraction. This paper proposes $LeGen$ {--} an end-to-end approach leveraging pre-trained large language models (GPT-4o, T5, BART) to perform complex information extraction from legal sentences. $LeGen$ learns and represents the discourse structure of legal sentences, capturing both their complexity and semantics. It minimizes error propagation typical in multi-step pipelines and achieves up to a 32.2{\%} gain on the Indian Legal benchmark. Additionally, it demonstrates competitive performance on open information extraction benchmarks. A promising application of the resulting legal knowledge graphs is in developing question-answering systems for government schemes, tailored to the Next Billion Users who struggle with the complexity of legal language.
